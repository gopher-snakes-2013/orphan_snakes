      It is a period of civil war.
      Rebel spaceships, striking
      from a hidden base, have won
      their first victory against
      the evil Galactic Empire.

      During the battle, Rebel
      spies managed to steal secret
      plans to the Empire's
      ultimate weapon, the DEATH
      STAR, an armored space
      station with enough power
      to destroy an entire planet.

      Pursued by the Empire's
      sinister agents, Princess
      Leia races home aboard her
      starship, custodian of the
      stolen plans that can save her
      people and restore
      freedom to the galaxy...
