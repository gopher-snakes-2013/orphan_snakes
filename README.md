A 3D-star-wars-typeracer
========================
The awesome Star Wars opening crawl from 1977 as a typeracer.
It's written in object-oriented JavaScript. It also makes heavy use of advanced CSS 3 like animations, keyframes, or perspective transformations to achieve the desired 3d crawl effect.

Play it [here](http://starwarsracer.herokuapp.com/).

Can you finish it?
